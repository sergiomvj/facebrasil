# Project Goals — facebrasil (FBR.NEWS)

This document is the **source of truth** for what this project is for.
Any implementation, feature request, or backlog item must be evaluated against these goals.

## 1) Mission
Transform Facebrasil from a traditional news portal into a **mobile-first digital ecosystem** that **informs, guides, connects and empowers** Brazilians living in (or moving to) the United States.

## 2) Strategic goals
1. **Utility-first content + services**
   - Go beyond news: deliver actionable guidance, tools, and services that solve real problems.

2. **Vertical specialization**
   - Organize experience by real-life needs (e.g., immigration, work, education, health, life in the US).
   - Each vertical combines articles + guides + interactive tools + specialist assistance.

3. **Community-centered product**
   - Treat users as community members: engagement loops, recognition, feedback-driven iteration.
   - Enable sustainable community growth (not clickbait).

4. **IA as facilitator (not protagonist)**
   - Use AI for curation, personalization and assistance (specialist agents), while preserving editorial intent.

5. **Scalable architecture**
   - Modular, modern stack enabling continuous evolution, rapid launches of new tools, and multi-product expansion.

6. **Sustainable monetization**
   - Contextual ads, premium services, partnerships, marketplace/affiliates.
   - Monetization must align with user value and editorial ethics.

## 3) Product principles (guardrails)
- **Mobile-first** always.
- **Clarity over jargon** (especially for immigration/legal topics).
- **Trust and usefulness** > traffic.
- **Services integrated** into content flows (not separate destinations).

## 4) Non-goals
- Becoming a generic entertainment/news aggregator.
- AI-generated content without accountability/quality control.
- Growth tactics that undermine trust (intrusive ads, dark patterns).

## 5) Decision rule (“Should we do this?”)
Approve changes if they:
- increase real-world user utility (time saved, clarity gained, tasks completed),
- improve vertical specialization or service integration,
- strengthen community engagement without harming trust,
- improve scalability/operability.

Defer/reject if they are:
- purely cosmetic without measurable user benefit,
- engagement hacks that reduce trust,
- AI features that reduce human oversight and quality.
